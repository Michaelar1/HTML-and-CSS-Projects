			<h2>The &lt; Article &gt; Tag</h2>
			<br>
			<p>The &lt; article &gt; tag groups together self-contained content. The content within the &lt; article &gt; tags should make sense on its own independent of the rest of the site.</p>

		<details>
			<summary>This &lt; summary &gt; tag is used with the &lt; details &gt; tag as a heading.</summary>

			It is usually used to make the site more interactive.</p>
		</details>

		<!-- TIME TAG -->
			<ht>The &lt; time &gt; Tag</h2>
			<p> The &lt; time &gt; is used for tagging specific times, such as <time>5:22</time>.<br>

			This is seen here: <time datetime="2023-01-01 00:00">New Year's Day</time>
