		<h1>The Differences Between Popular Language-Learning Apps</h1>
		<p>When one wants to learn a language, there are so many options available. There are very popular free apps, like Duolingo and Memrise which also have subscription options with extra bonus features for those willing to pay a few extra dollars. Then there is Babbel, a fully subscription service that comes with entirely different perks. But what is the difference?</p>
		<div style="color: lawngreen">
			<p>The most popular language app is Duolingo. Duolingo is notorious for its constant reminders to use its app daily, giving the feeling that you're being stalked by Duo, Duolingo's green owl mascot. Duolingo is a completely immersive language learning environment with little to no supportive instruction in English. The point is to get the user to learn the language as a child would - by learning vocabulary and then learning sentence structure through context. Mind, you can look for answers to questions on their forum, but the program itself doesn't include things like grammar or syntax rules. Its popularity comes from its open-source contribution to language learning and the fact that all of the content is accessible for free. However, a lot of the initial phrases are not as practical, perhaps to get the learner to think about each word in the phrase. Phrases like, "The duck and the spider eat an apple," for example, are unlikely to come up in regular conversation, but are good for demonstrating grammar rules that aren't taught explicitly.</p>

			<p>A personal favorite of mine is Memrise. Memrise is primarily great for vocabulary study with multiple approaches to learning both useful words and phrases. The main programs available through Memrise feature videos of native speakers who all seem to have been randomly approached to recite the phrases to be learned. This honestly makes the learning entertaining and it also gets the user used to hearing the language as it is spoken by people who speak it all the time - that is, quickly. Memrise also has the perk of allowing you to create your own learning programs, which can be added to a library for any user to peruse.</p>

		<div style="color: darkorange"> 
			<p>Finally, there is Babbel. Babbel has the most useful phrases and, unlike the other two, explicitly teaches grammar, syntax, and exact pronunciation. It is rather expensive, but it has a similar interface as the prohibitively expensive Rosetta Stone. It is a mixture between the immersive language learning - almost identical to Rosetta Stone in this aspect - and explicit language learning. It is extremely useful for this aspect and is worth the money if you have it. It also teaches about the culture and other aspects of the language not seen in other apps. However, certain modules are a bit buggy, and recent updates to the app have been even more problematic in speaking modules in particular.</p>
		</div>
		<p>No matter which app you use - I personally use all three - you will find an educational experience that will be fun and intuitive to use. Language learning is fun and gives you an additional skill to use in both your career and in world travel.</p>
