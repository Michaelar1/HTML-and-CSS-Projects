	<h2>I Sit Beside the Fire and Think</h2>
	<br>
	<p>I sit beside the fire and think of all that I have seen, <br>
	Of meadow-flowers and butterflies in <span style="font-style:bold;color:Crimson">summers</span> that have been; <br>
	Of yellow leaves and gossamer in <span style="font-style:bold;color:Goldenrod">autumns</span> that there were, <br>
	With morning mist and silver sun and wind upon my har. <br>
	I sit beside the fire and think of how the world would be <br>
	When <span style="font-style:bold;color:LightSlateGray">winter</span> comes without a <span="font-style:bold;color:LightGreen">spring</span> that I shall ever see. <br>
	<br>
	For still there are so many things that I have never seen: <br>
	In every wood in every <span style="font-style:bold;color:MediumSpringGreen">spring</span> there is a different green. <br>
	I sit beside the fire and think of people long ago, <br>
	And people who will see a world that I shall never know. <br>
	But all the while I sit and think of times there were before, <br>
	I listen for returning feet and voices at the door.<br>
