		<h3>HTML Entities</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Character entities are used to display characters that are reserved in HTML, like the &lt; sign or the &gt; sign.</li>
			<li>A non-breaking space entity keeps words together when a space would put the second word on a new lign. This is useful if breaking them up would disrupt the meaning of the words.</li>
			<li>Diacritical marks are marks added to letters or characters like accents. This would be important for languages where these marks are used frequently, like the tilde on an n in Spanish: n&#771;.</li>
			<li>Entities have varying ways you can represent them in your program, such as entity names and entity numbers. The entity names are easier to remember, as they contain near-English abbreviations for what each entity does. However, browsers might not support certain entity names, but the entity numbers are widely supported.</li>
